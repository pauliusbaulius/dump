#   FINAL EXERCISE OF THE CHAPTER 3
#   MAKE A GUESSING GAME
#       1. random number gets generated
#       2. you guess it until you get it right
#       3. guess number from 1 to 20
import random, sys

num = random.randint(1,20)

while True:
    print('Guess a number between 1 and 20: ')
    #   take user input from console
    guess = int(input())
    #   if the guess is not in range exit the program
    if guess > 20 or guess < 1:
        print('Not within the range!')
        sys.exit()
    #   if the guess is right break the loop
    if guess == num:
        print('You have guessed right!')
        break
    #   if guess is bigger than secret number, print 'Guess is too big.'
    #   else print 'Guess is too low.'
    if guess > num:
        print('Guess is too big.')
