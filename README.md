Various smaller code samples I've implemented. Most of it comes from university assignments and extra stuff from the slides.

- Algorithms & Data Structures

  - Sorting
    - [Insertionsort](insertion_sort.py)
      Simplest sorting algorithm.
    - [Bogosort](bogo_sort.py)
      Fastest sorting algorithm if you are lucky. *Best possible runtime beats all other algorithms. Average and worst runtimes are not.*
    - [Bubblesort](bubble_sort.py)
    - [Selectionsort](selection_sort.py)
    - [Quicksort](quick_sort.py)
    - [Mergesort](merge_sort.py)
    - Hybridsort #TODO
      Insertionsort + Mergesort. Uses insertionsort for small subarrays.

  - Data Structures
    - Red-Black-Tree #TODO
      Very annoying trees used in Linux Completely Fair Scheduler.
    - Skip-List #TODO

- [Egyptian Multiplication](egyptian_multiplication.py)
  Multiple numbers without '*'.

- [Sieve Of Eratosthenes](sieve_of_eratosthenes.py)
  Calculate array of prime numbers.

- [Square Root](square_root.py)
  Various square root calculation implementations.

- [Gaussian Sum](gauss.py)

- [Iterative Factorial](factorial.py)
  Generate array of factorials. Array index is the number. Value at that index is factor of it.

- [Monte-Carlo-Algorithm](pi_parallel.c)
  C implementation with multiprocessing using OpenMP.

- Python DOS #TODO
